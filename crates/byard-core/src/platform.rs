//! # Platform abstraction
//!
//! Defines [`PlatformHost`] — the only point of contact between the engine
//! core and a concrete windowing backend (`winit`, a future mobile host,
//! the headless *Coreolis* embedding, etc.), per RFC-0001 §6.
//!
//! `byard-core` has zero direct references to `winit`, Wayland, Win32, or
//! any other OS primitive. This module does not either: [`WindowSize`] is
//! expressed in plain `u32`/`f64`, and the only non-`std` types in the trait
//! signature ([`wgpu::Instance`], [`wgpu::Surface`]) are already a dependency
//! of `byard-core` for rendering, not for windowing. A concrete host (e.g.
//! `byard-platform`'s `WinitHost`) owns the actual window and event loop,
//! and calls into a [`PlatformHost`] implementation in response to OS events:
//!
//! ```text
//!   Host (WinitHost / etc.)                     Application code
//!   ──────────────────────                      ──────────────────────────────
//!   window + surface created  ──────────────►   PlatformHost::on_resume
//!   resize / DPI change       ──────────────►   PlatformHost::on_resize
//!   RedrawRequested            ──────────────►   PlatformHost::on_redraw
//!   mouse button press/release ──────────────►   PlatformHost::on_pointer_input
//!   close button / Cmd+Q       ──────────────►   PlatformHost::on_close_requested
//! ```
//!
//! The application implements [`PlatformHost`] once and it works unchanged
//! against any host. The host crate is the only place `winit` (or whatever
//! the next backend is) appears in the dependency tree.
